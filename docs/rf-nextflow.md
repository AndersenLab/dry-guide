# Nextflow

[TOC]


Nextflow is an awesome program that allows you to write a computational pipeline by making it simpler to put together many different tasks, maybe even using different programming languages. Nextflow makes parallelism easy and works with SLURM to schedule jobs so you don't have to! Nextflow also supports docker containers and conda enviornments to streamline reproducible pipelines and can be easily adapted to run on different systems - including Google Cloud! Not convinced? Check out this [intro](https://www.nextflow.io/).

# Installation

Nextflow can be installed with two easy steps:

```
# download with wget or curl
wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash

# or #

curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash

# make binary executable on your system
chmod +x nextflow

# Move nextflow to directory accessible by your $PATH to avoid having to type full path to nextflow each time
# you can check your $PATH with:
echo $PATH

# it likely contains `/usr/local/bin` so you could move nextflow there
mv nextflow /usr/local/bin/

```

## Nextflow versions

You might also want to update nextflow or be able to run different versions. This can be done in several different ways

1. Update Nextflow

```
nextflow self-update
```

2. Use a specific version of Nextflow

```
NXF_VER=20.04.0 nextflow run main.nf
```

3. Use the `nf20` conda environment built for AndersenLab pipelines

```
module load anaconda3/2022.05
source activate /home/<jheid>/data_eande106/software/conda_envs/nf20_env
```

!!! Important
  If you run the `nf20` conda environment, **please do not try to update nextflow, this will cause permission denied errors for other lab members**. You can deactivate the conda environment with `source deactivate`

(You can check your Nextflow version with `nextflow -v` or `nextflow --version`)

!!! Note
	If you load this conda environment, it is not necessary to have Nextflow version 20 installed on your system -- you don't even need to have Nextflow installed at all! Because different versions might have updates that affect the running of Nextflow, it is important to keep track of the version of Nextflow you are using, as well as all software packages.

!!! Important
	Many of the Andersen Lab pipelines (if not all) are written with the new `DSL2` (see below) which requires Nextflow-v20.0+. Loading the `nf20` conda environment is a great way to run these pipelines

# Rockfish cluster configuration

Configuration files allow you to define the way a pipeline is executed on Rockfish. 

> Read the [nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html) on configuration files

Configuration files are defined at a global level in `~/.nextflow/config` and on a per-pipeline basis within `<pipeline_directory>/nextflow.config`. Settings written in `<pipeline_directory>/nextflow.config` override settings written in `~/.nextflow/config`.

## Global Configuration: `~/.nextflow/config`

In order to use nextflow on Rockfish you will need to define some global variables regarding the process. Our lab utilizies nodes and space dedicated to genomics projects. In order to access these resources your account will need to be granted access. Contact Erik to be added to the eande106 group and granted permissions for Vast. Once you have access you will need to modify your global configuration. Set your `~/.nextflow/config` file to be the following:

```
process {
    executor = 'slurm'
    queue = 'parallel'
    clusterOptions = '-A eande106 -t 24:00:00 -e errlog.txt'
}

#The scratch space directory where workDir and tmpDir will be directed to is currently a work in progress#
workDir = "/path/to/scratch/storage/work/<your name>/"
tmpDir = "/path/to/scratch/storage/tmp"

```

This configuration file does the following:

* `executor` - Sets the executor to `slurm` scheduler
* `queue` - Sets the queue/partition to `parallel` which submits jobs to Rockfish nodes.
* `clusterOptions` - Sets the account/allocation to `eande106`; granting access to `parallel` and other queues.
* `workDir` - Sets the working directory to scratch space. To better organization, Please build your own folder under `[TBD]`, and define it here.
* `tmpDir` - Creates a temporary working directory. This can be used within workflows when necessary.


# Running Nextflow

Theoretically, running a Nextflow pipeline should be very straightforward (although with any developing pipelines there are always bugs to work out).

## Running Nextflow from a remote directory

The prefered (and sometimes easiest) way to run a nextflow pipeline can be done in just one single step. When this works (see troubleshooting section below), pipelines can be run without first cloning the git repo. You can just tell Nextflow which git repo to use and it will do the rest! This can be helpful to reduce clutter and avoid making changes to the actual pipeline. Additionally, this method allows you to control which branch and/or commit of the pipeline to run, and Nextflow will automatically track that information for you allowing for great reproducibility.

!!! Note
  There is no need to clone a copy of the repo to run pipelines this way. Behind the scenes, nextflow is actually cloning the repo to your home directory and keeping track of branches/commits. 

```
# example command to run the latest version of NemaScan
nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan \
--traitfile input_data/c_elegans/phenotypes/test_pheno.tsv \
--vcf 20210121

# Note: can also write in one line, the \ were used to make the code more readable:
nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan --traitfile input_data/c_elegans/phenotypes/test_pheno.tsv --vcf 20210121
```

!!! Note
	Parameters or arguments to Nextflow scripts are designated with the `--`. In the case above, there is a parameter called "in" which we are setting to be the `test.tsv` file.

When Nextflow is running, it will print to the console the name of each process in the pipeline as well as update on the progress of the script:

![nextflow example](img/nextflow_example.png)

For example, in the above screenshot from a NemaScan run, there are 14 different processes in the pipeline. Notice that the `fix_strain_names_bulk` process has already completed! Meanwhile, the `vcf_t_geno_matrix` process is still running. You can also see that the `prepare_gcta_files` is actually run 4 times (in this case, because it is run once per 4 traits in my dataset).

Another important piece of information from this Nextflow run is the hash that designates the working directory of each process. the `[ad/eea615]` next to the `fix_strain_names_bulk` process indicates that the working directory is located at `path_to_nextflow_working_directory/ad/eea615...`. This can be helpful if you want to go into that directory to see what is actually happening or trouble shoot errors.

!!! Note
	I highly recommend adding this function to your `~/.bash_profile` to easily access the Nexflow working directory: `gw() {cd /path/to/scratch/space/work/<your_name>/$1*}` so that when you type `gw 3f/6a21a5` (the hash Nextflow shows that indicates the specific working directory for a process) you will go to that folder automatically.

### Running a different branch of a pipeline

Instead of cloning the repo and then remembering to switch branches, you can specify the branch in your nextflow call. This is most beneficial because the pipeline will then keep a record of which branch you used so future you doesn't have to remember.

```
# the following command runs the "develop" branch of nemascan 
# (not recommended unless you know what you are doing, might break)
nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan \
--traitfile input_data/c_elegans/phenotypes/test_pheno.tsv \
--vcf 20210121 \
-r develop
```

### Running a specific commit

Sometimes we want to keep the version of a pipeline the same across several different runs (maybe preparing for a manuscript etc.). To do this, you can again use the `-r` argument and just provide the commit ID which is a long alphanumeric code that can be found on github or in the log of your previous nextflow run.

```
# the following command runs will always run the exact same code, no matter how many changes to nemascan there are in the future
nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan \
--traitfile input_data/c_elegans/phenotypes/test_pheno.tsv \
--vcf 20210121 \
-r 769a2b75545d7f870a880447dd31482cfc628792
```

### Troubleshooting remote pipelines

For some reason, running nextflow remotely sometimes throws errors and I am not 100% sure why. Here are some of the most common errors I see and how to fix them.

**1. It doesn't pull the latest commit**

* Go to github.com and find the latest commit ID and use that with `-r XXX` (see above on running specific commits)
* If that doesn't work, you might have to clone the repo and run it locally (see below)

**2. It says the "repository may be corrupt"**

* I don't understand this error, but I think it happens when you try to run different branches/commits. Usually, I just go to the path where the error says is corrupt and delete the folder with `rm -rf`. For example:

```
rm -rf /home/<jheid>/.nextflow/assets/andersenlab/nemascan
```

!!! Warning
  You should always be careful when using `rm`, *especially* `rm -rf`. There is no going back. Make certain you want to delete the folder and everything inside it. In this case, it will be fine because nextflow will just clone it again fresh.

## Running Nextflow from a local directory

Another way to run Nextflow is by first cloning the git repo to your directory and then running the pipeline. This has advantages and disadvantages over running the pipeline remotely (see below), however if you need to make changes to the pipeline specific to your analysis, you will **need** to follow these steps.

```
git clone https://github.com/AndersenLab/NemaScan.git
cd NemaScan
nextflow run main.nf --debug
```

## Resume

Another great thing about Nextflow is that it caches all the processes that completed successfully, so if you have an error at the middle or end of your pipeline, you can re-run the same Nextflow command with `-resume` and it will start where it finished last time!

```
nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan \
--traitfile input_data/c_elegans/phenotypes/test_pheno.tsv \
--vcf 20210121 \
-resume
```

There is usually no downside to adding `-resume`, so you can get into the habit of always adding it if you want.

!!! Important
	There is some confusion with how the `-resume` works and sometimes it doesn't work as expected. Check out [this](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2019/demystifying-nextflow-resume.html) and [this other](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2019/troubleshooting-nextflow-resume.html) guide for more help. One thing I've learned is there is a difference between `process.cache = 'deep' vs. 'lenient'`.

## Getting an email or text when complete

If you would like to receive an email or text from Nextflow when your pipeline finishes (either successfully or with error), all you need to do is add `-N <email>` to your code. Most phone companies have a way to "email" your phone as an SMS, so you can use this email address to get a text alert. For example:

```
# send email
nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan --debug -N kathryn.evans@northwestern.edu

# send text to 801-867-5309 with verizon
nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan --debut -N 8018675309@vtext.com
```
