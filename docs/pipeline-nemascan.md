## Software Requirements

* This pipeline requires Nextflow version 20.0+. On QUEST, you can access this version by loading the `nf20` conda environment prior to running the pipeline command:

```
module load python/anaconda3.6
source activate /projects/b1059/software/conda_envs/nf20_env
```

Alternatively you can update Nextflow by running:

```
nextflow self-update
```

* On QUEST, all software requirements are provided within the pipeline using conda environments or a docker image. To run the pipeline outside of QUEST, you can load the docker image containing all necessary software, see more in `profiles` below.

# Usage

!!! Note
  It is not necessary to first download the git repo before running. However, you could still choose to do so with `git clone https://github.com/AndersenLab/NemaScan.git`

## Testing/debugging the mapping profile

If you are trying to run a GWAS mapping with NemaScan, it might be a good idea to first run the debug test. This test takes only a few minutes and if it completes successfully, there is a good chance your real data run will also finish.

```
nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan --debug
```

To display the help message, run `nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan --help` 

# Profiles and Parameters

## Mappings Profile

This is the standard profile for running NemaScan. Use this profile to perform a genome-wide analysis with your trait of interest. To be explicit, you can use `-profile mappings`, however if no profile is provided, the pipeline will default to this one.

```
nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan -profile mappings --vcf 20210121 --traitfile input_data/c_elegans/phenotypes/PC1.tsv
```

!!! Note
  You can also run specific branches or previous git commits easily. This can be especially useful to ensure that the version of NemaScan that you use doesn't change as you prepare your manuscript even if the code is updated.
  All you need to do is add a `-r XXX` to the end of your command, where `XXX` can be either (1) name of git branch, (2) name of git repo release, or (3) git commit ID
  **For all runs, you can find the exact git commit used to run your analysis in the Nextflow report output after each run**

```
nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan --vcf 20210121 --traitfile input_data/c_elegans/phenotypes/PC1.tsv -r fa7046475fcfd06a49b375b4ef24a761f5133600

```

**Check out [this page](quest-nextflow.md) for more tips and troubleshooting running Nextflow.**

### --vcf

CeNDR release date for the VCF file with variant data (i.e. "20210121") Hard-filter VCF will be used for the GWA mapping and imputed VCF will be used for fine mapping. If this flag is not used, the most recent VCF for the _C. elegans_ species will be downloaded from [CeNDR](https://elegansvariation.org/data/release/latest).

!!! Note
  If you want to use a custom VCF, you may provide the full path to the vcf in place of the CeNDR release date. This custom VCF will be used for BOTH GWA mapping and fine-mapping steps (instead of the imputed vcf).

### --traitfile

A tab-delimited formatted (.tsv) file that contains trait information.  Each phenotype file should be in the following format (replace trait_name with the phenotype of interest):

| strain | trait_name_1 | trait_name_2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JU258 | 32.73 | 19.34 |
| ECA640 | 34.065378 | 12.32 |
| ... | ... | ... | 124.33 |
| ECA250 | 34.096 | 23.1 |


#### Optional Mapping Parameters

* `--species` - Choose between `c_elegans` (DEFAULT), `c_tropicalis` or `c_briggsae`

* `--sthresh` - This determines the signficance threshold required for performing post-mapping analysis of a QTL. `BF` corresponds to Bonferroni correction, `EIGEN` corresponds to correcting for the number of independent markers in your data set, and `user-specified` corresponds to a user-defined threshold, where you replace user-specified with a number. For example `--sthresh=4` will set the threshold to a `-log10(p)` value of 4. We recommend using the strict `BF` correction as a first pass to see what the resulting data looks like. If the pipeline stops at the `summarize_maps` process, no significant QTL were discovered with the input threshold. You might want to consider lowering the threshold if this occurs. (Default: `BF`)

* `--mediation` - 'true' or 'false' input for whether or not to run the mediation analysis (overlapping expression variation with phenotypic variation to drive a QTL). (Default: `true`)

* `--out` - A user-specified output directory name. (Default: `Analysis_Results-{date}`)

* `--group_qtl` - QTL within this distance of each other (bp) will be grouped as a single QTL by `Find_GCTA_Intervals_*.R`. (Default: 1000)

* `--ci_size` - The number of markers for which the detection interval will be extended past the last significant marker in the interval. (Default: 150)

* `--maf` - The minor allele frequency for filtering variants to use for gwas mapping (default 0.05)

## Genomatrix Profile

This profile takes a list of strains and outputs the genotype matrix but does not perform any other analysis for the genome-wide association. 

```
nextflow run develop.nf -profile genomatrix --vcf 20210121 --strains input_data/elegans/phenotypes/strain_file.tsv
```

### --vcf

CeNDR release date for the VCF file with variant data (i.e. "20210121") Hard-filter VCF will be used for the GWA mapping and imputed VCF will be used for fine mapping. If this flag is not used, the most recent VCF for the _C. elegans_ species will be downloaded from [CeNDR](https://elegansvariation.org/data/release/latest). **Alternatively, you could choose to provide the full path to a custom VCF**

### --strains

A file (.tsv) that contains a list of strains used for generating the genotype matrix. There is no header:

```
JU258
ECA640
...
ECA250
```

## Simulations Profile

This profile uses simulations to establish GWA performance benchmarks. Users can specify the heritability of simulated traits, the number of QTL underlying simulated traits of interest, the strains the user intends to use in a prospective GWA mapping experiment, or the location of previously detected QTL. Understanding the null expectations of GWA mappings within given parameter spaces may provide experimenters with additional guidance before initiating an experiment, or serve as a validation tool for previous mappings.

```
nextflow develop.nf -profile simulations --vcf 20210121 --simulate_nqtl input_data/all_species/simulate_nqtl.csv --simulate_reps 2 --simulate_h2 input_data/all_species/simulate_h2.csv --simulate_eff input_data/all_species/simulate_effect_sizes.csv --simulate_strains input_data/all_species/simulate_strains.tsv --out example_simulation_output
module load R/3.6.3
Rscript bin/Assess_Simulated_Mappings.R example_simulation_output
```

### --vcf

CeNDR release date for the VCF file with variant data (i.e. "20210121") Hard-filter VCF will be used for the GWA mapping and imputed VCF will be used for fine mapping. If this flag is not used, the most recent VCF for the _C. elegans_ species will be downloaded from [CeNDR](https://elegansvariation.org/data/release/latest).

### --simulate_nqtl 
A single column CSV file that defines the number of QTL to simulate (format: one number per line, no column header) (Default is provided: `input_data/all_species/simulate_nqtl.csv`).

### --simulate_reps
The number of replicates to simulate per number of QTL and heritability (Default: 2).

### --simulate_h2 
A CSV file with phenotype heritability. (format: one value per line, no column header) (Default is located: `input_data/all_species/simulate_h2.csv`).

### --simulate_eff
A CSV file specifying a range of causal QTL effects. QTL effects will be drawn from a uniform distribution bound by these two values. If the user wants to specify _Gamma_ distributed effects, the value in this file can be simply specified as "gamma". (format: one value per line, no column header) (Default is located: input_data/all_species/simulate_effect_sizes.csv).

### --simulate_strains
A TSV file specifying the population in which to simulate GWA mappings. Multiple populations can be simulated at once, but causal QTL will be drawn independently for each population as a result of minor allele frequency and LD pruning prior to mapping. (format: one line per population; supplied population name and a comma-separated list of each strain in the population) (Default is located: input_data/all_species/simulate_strains.tsv).

#### Optional Simulation Parameters

* `--simulate_maf` - A single column CSV file that defines the minor allele frequency threshold used to filter the VCF prior to simulations (Default: 0.05).

* `--simulate_qtlloc` - A .bed file specifying genomic regions from which causal QTL are to be drawn after MAF filtering and LD pruning. (format: CHROM START END for each genomic region, with no header. NOTE: CHROM is specified as NUMERIC, not roman numerals as is convention in _C. elegans_)(Default is located: input_data/all_species/simulate_locations.bed).

* `--group_qtl` - QTL within this distance of each other (bp) will be grouped as a single QTL by `Find_GCTA_Intervals_*.R`. (Default: 1000)

* `--ci_size` - The number of markers for which the detection interval will be extended past the last significant marker in the interval. (Default: 150)

## Annotations Profile (in development)

`nextflow develop.nf --vcf 20210121 -profile annotations --species briggsae --wb_build WS270`

* `--species` - specifies what species information to download from WormBase (options: elegans, briggsae, tropicalis).

* `--wb_build` - specifies what WormBase build to download annotation information from (format: WSXXX, where XXX is a number greater than 270 and less than 277).


## GWA Mapping with Docker Profile

This profile uses a docker image instead of local conda environments to perform the GWA mapping. Use this profile if you have issue with conda on QUEST or if you are running the pipeline outside of quest. *NOTE: Docker or singularity is required*

**On QUEST:**
```
module load singularity
nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan --traitfile <file> --vcf 20210121 -profile mappings_docker
```

**Local**
*make sure you have installed docker and that it is actively running. See [here](http://andersenlab.org/dry-guide/latest/pipeline-docker/) for help.*

```
nextflow run andersenlab/nemascan --traitfile <file> --vcf 20210121 -profile local

```

### Genotype_Matrix folder
* `*Genotype_Matrix.tsv` - pruned LD-pruned genotype matrix used for GWAS and construction of kinship matrix. This will be appended with the chosen minor allele frequency cutoff and strain set, as they are generated separately for each strain set.
* `*total_independent_tests.txt` - number of independent tests determined through spectral decomposition of the genotype matrix. This will be also be appended with the chosen minor allele frequency cutoff and strain set, as they are generated separately for each strain set.

### Simulations
* `NemaScan_Performance.*.RData` - RData file containing all simulated and detected QTL from each successful simulated mapping. Contains:
1. Simulated and Detected status for each QTL.
2. Minor allele frequency and simulated or estimated effect for each QTL.
3. Detection interval according to specified grouping size and CI extension.
4. Estimated variance explained for each detected QTL.
5. Simulation parameters and the algorithm used for that particular regime.

### Mappings
* As with the mapping profile, raw and processed mappings for each simulation regime are nested within folders corresponding each specified effect range and number of simulated QTL. QTL region files are not provided in the simulation profile; this information along with other information related to mapping performance are iteratively gathered in the generation of the performance .RData file.

### Phenotypes
* `[nQTL]_[rep]_[h2]_[MAF]_[effect range]_[strain_set]_sims.phen` - Simulated strain phenotypes for each simulation regime.
* `[nQTL]_[rep]_[h2]_[MAF]_[effect range]_[strain_set]_sims.par` - Simulated QTL effects for each simulation regime. NOTE: Simulation regimes with identical numbers of simulated QTL, replicate indices, and simulated heritabilities should have _identical_ simulated QTL and effects.
