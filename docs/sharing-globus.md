# Sharing files with Globus

[TOC]

## Setting up a share

1. Sign in to [Globus](https://app.globus.org/file-manager). The account doesn't have to be Northwestern-affiliated, but you will have to sign in with your Northwestern credentials to access Quest anyways, so might as well.
2. In "Collection", search for "Northwestern Quest", then authenticate with your Northwestern account (if you didn't already in step 1).

3. If you just authenticated, might need to search "Northwestern Quest" in the Collection again.
4. Navigate to the folder you want to share, click "Share", and follow the prompts.
