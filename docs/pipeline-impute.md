# VCF Imputation

[TOC]

Although there is not a full "pipeline" for imputation, there is a script to run and this step is crucial, as fine-mapping for NemaScan requires an imputed VCF.

## Software requirements

You can run this script on QUEST using the latest version of Beagle (5.2) in the `/projects/b1059/software/` folder. Also requires `bcftools` (loaded in script).

## Usage

1. Copy the script above and create a new file on QUEST (i.e. `impute.sh`). 
2. Manually edit the `vcf` input, the `species`, and the `date` (to be the release date for all VCFs). 
3. Submit the job with `sbatch impute.sh`

## Parameters

These parameters have been checked and decided on by previous lab members and Erik. Some chromosomes might require a window size of 3 and an overlap of 1. In recent conversation with the person who manages Beagle, they mentioned we should probably use default values unless we have done simulations to show these values are better. Note for the future maybe.
